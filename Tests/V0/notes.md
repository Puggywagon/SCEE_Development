# Overview

## queries

- Write the sequence of codes that should be run.

- Write a quick description of main function of each of the class

- MD_Simulations.py

  Merge MD_Simulations.py and Pre_Eq_Simulations.py.  What are the
  main differences between these two classes?

- SCEE.py

  What is the difference between SCEE.pym PCM1.py, PCM2.py, and
  Vacuum.py?  We should try to unify these two classes into a single
  class PCM.py.

- Oniom_Generation.py
  - Calc_Heavys():
  
    Use if (Gro_Atom_Types in Gro_Atom_Type_list): heavy_atoms += 1
  
  - gro_to_gaus(): 
  
    Use dictionaries rather than if/elif statements.
